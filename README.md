# Stormcloud

An awesome weather app.

* Design and Dev by @consindo
* Icons (Climacons) by @AdamWhitcroft
* Weather by Yahoo
* Inspiration from @d0od, @sil and @GeorgeCzabania

This is a recreation of the popular Ubuntu application written by consindo (https://github.com/consindo/stormcloud)

The purpose of this is to make the great looking weather application available cross platform.

Most of the code was written from the ground up by me (with the use of some usefull libraries of course).

# Usage

Until I upload downloadable packages for each environment you must have [TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org/)

1. Clone this Repo
2. Download TideSDK and click "Import Project"
3. Click "Launch Application"

Once the application is in a suitable state I will bundle packages for each operating system and host them in the downloads section.
